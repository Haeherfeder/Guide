# Aiding

Players can assist each other directly using the `aid` feature, which allows sending pawns to another player's settlement.

## How to Use

1. **Select Target Settlement**: From the world view window, select the settlement you wish to send aid to.
2. **Send Aid**: Click the `Aid` button and choose the pawn you wish to send to help the selected settlement.

## Important Notes

1. **Cooldown Timer**: If the server has the setting enabled, there is a 1-hour cooldown period before you can aid the same player again. This setting can be adjusted in the `ServerConfig.json` file inside the `Core` folder of the server.
2. **Online Requirement**: The target player must be online to receive aid.
