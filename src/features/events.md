# Events

Players can trigger various events at each other's colonies by selecting a settlement on the world map and paying a fee determined by the server owner.

## Fees

The server owner can set the silver cost for events in the `EventValues.json` file located in the `Core` folder. By default, all events are free to trigger.

## How to Use

1. **Select Settlement**: From the world map, select the settlement you wish to target.
2. **Trigger Event**: Click the `Event` button and choose the event you wish to invoke.

## Important Notes

- **Cooldown Period**: If the server has the setting enabled, there is a 1-hour cooldown before the same player can be targeted again. This can be adjusted in the `ServerConfig.json` file inside the `Core` folder.
- **Silver Requirement**: The player triggering the event must carry enough silver to cover the event fee.
- **Target Must Be Online**: The target player must be online for the event to be triggered.

## Available Events

With this mod, players can send various in-game events to each other for a silver fee set by the server owner. Available events include:

- **Raid**: An enemy raid will attack the target.
- **Infestation**: A sudden infestation of dangerous creatures will occur.
- **Mech Cluster**: A mechanoid cluster will land near the target, posing a threat.
- **Toxic Fallout**: A toxic fallout event will blanket the area, affecting crops and health.
- **Manhunter Pack**: A pack of manhunting animals will attack the target.
- **Wanderer**: A wanderer with potentially useful traits will arrive at the settlement.
- **Farm Animals**: Additional farm animals will appear at the target location.
- **Ship Chunk**: A chunk of a crashed ship will land, containing valuable resources.
- **Trader Caravan**: A caravan of traders will arrive, offering goods for trade.

## How to Trigger Events

1. Move a caravan to the settlement of the player you wish to send an event to.
2. Click the `Events` button.
3. Choose an event from the list.
4. Pay the associated fee with silver.
