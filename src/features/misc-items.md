# Misc Items

This mod includes miscellaneous items that can be used to carry out simple functions to enhance gameplay and server interactions.

## Transfer Spot

The transfer spot acts as an entry point for any transfers you might receive from other players. Items given to you by other players will attempt to spawn on top of, or as close as possible to, this item. If you don't have a transfer spot on your map, received items will spawn at the center of the map.

## Chill Spot

The chill spot provides a designated area where your pawns will rest whenever another player visits your settlement while you are offline. This helps to manage pawn activities during visits and ensures they are not wandering aimlessly.

## Defense Spot

The defense spot is a strategic location where your pawns will hold their position whenever another player raids your settlement while you are offline. Pawns will stay at this spot until the raid begins, after which they will switch to NPC raid stances and engage the raiders.

## Hitching Spot

The hitching spot is used to tie animals and form caravans, preventing animals from wandering during encounters away from home.
