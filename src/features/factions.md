# Factions

Players can create factions to access useful features and collaborate more effectively in the long run.

## Creating a Faction

To create a faction, follow these steps:

1. **Open World Map**: Select one of your settlements.
2. **Faction Menu**: Click on the `Faction Menu` button.
3. **Create Faction**: If you don't belong to a faction, you'll be prompted to create one with a custom name.

## Benefits of Having a Faction

Having a faction allows you to invite other players, unlocking the following benefits:

- **Distinct Color Coding**: Faction members' settlements and sites will be displayed in a different color than those of other players.
- **Faction Sites**: Enables the construction of `faction sites` instead of normal ones, providing additional benefits. [Learn more about faction sites here](https://rimworldtogether.github.io/Guide/features/sites.html).
